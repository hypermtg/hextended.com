Update to the Hyper Extended Restricted List

All ante cards are banned.

Hyper Extended features a restricted list:

```
Burning Wish
Demonic Consultation
Dream Halls
Earthcraft
Enlightened Tutor
Frantic Search
Goblin Recruiter
Grim Monolith
Gush
Hermit Druid
Memory Jar
Mind’s Desire
Mystical Tutor
Necropotence
Personal Tutor
Tinker
Tolarian Academy
Vampiric Tutor
Windfall
Yawgmoth's Bargain
Yawgmoth's Will
```

OBSERVE LIST:

Unrestrict

With a restricted list in place, it can be argued that Tinker has few
targets that can be considered “broken.” A powerful card for sure but
possibly a candidate for unrestriction.

Restrict

Lion’s Eye Diamond has a converted mana cost of 0 and makes three mana
of any one color. It's pretty fucked with Yawgmoth's Will.

Oath of Druids is miserable but given the power level of the fatties
might not be that broken.

Hymn to Tourcock can lead to miserable starts and tends to homogenize
black cards around its existance. Duress and Hymn together can make
for starts that are almost un salvagable.

Also the following cards were banned at various points during
Extended’s existence and thus are worthy of observation in
Hyperextended.

```
Brainstorm
Dark Ritual
Entomb
Goblin Lackey
Lotus Petal
Metalworker
Mind Over Matter
Replenish
Survival of the Fittest
Time Spiral
```

Flash has been removed from the observe list because it's slower and
worse than the degenerate shit you can do with LED and Yawgmoth's
Will.
