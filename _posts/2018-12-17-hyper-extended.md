Hyper Extended is a constructed format which includes the following
sets

Fallen Empires -> Scourge. Including the Black Bordered Portal sets
One and Second Age.

No white bordered cards are allowed. No new frame or time shifted
trash is allowed. You must use the card from the set and can't use
reprints even going backwards. For example Ice Age contains Swords to
Plowshares, you can't use a Revised one, or a crappy 4th one. You
can't even use a gorgeous Beta one. Wrath of God is found only in
Portal, you must use that one. If a card is in multiple legal sets you
may use any, or mix and match to trigger your opponents.

Ferrin cards are encouraged to further confuse opponents.

All ante cards are banned.

Hyper Extended features a restricted list:

```
Ancient Tomb
Burning Wish
Demonic Consultation
Dream Halls
Earthcraft
Enlightened Tutor
Frantic Search
Goblin Recruiter
Grim Monolith
Gush
Hermit Druid
Memory Jar
Mind’s Desire
Mystical Tutor
Necropotence
Personal Tutor
Tinker
Tolarian Academy
Vampiric Tutor
Windfall
Yawgmoth's Bargain
Yawgmoth's Will
```

OBSERVE LIST:

Unrestrict

With a restricted list in place, it can be argued that Tinker has few
targets that can be considered “broken.” A powerful card for sure but
possibly a candidate for unrestriction.

Restrict

Flash is the basis of a degenerate, and frankly, boring turn one combo
that I completely forgot about. I don’t think anyone will have a good
time with four copies of this spell hanging around, but we can try it
as a playset first.

Lion’s Eye Diamond has a converted mana cost of 0 and makes three mana
of any one color. It's pretty fucked with Yawgmoth's Will.

Oath of Druids is miserable but given the power level of the fatties
might not be that broken.
