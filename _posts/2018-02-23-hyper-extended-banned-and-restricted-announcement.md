OBSERVE LIST:

Unrestrict

With a restricted list in place, it can be argued that Tinker has few
targets that can be considered “broken.” A powerful card for sure but
possibly a candidate for unrestriction.

Restrict

Flash is the basis of a degenerate, and frankly, boring turn one combo
that I completely forgot about. I don’t think anyone will have a good
time with four copies of this spell hanging around, but we can try it
as a playset first.

Lion’s Eye Diamond has a converted mana cost of 0 and makes three mana
of any one color. It's pretty fucked with Yawgmoth's Will.

Oath of Druids is miserable but given the power level of the fatties
might not be that broken.

Hymn to Tourcock can lead to miserable starts and tends to homogenize
black cards around its existance. Duress and Hymn together can make
for starts that are almost un salvagable.
