<<<< The council has spoken, the final ruling from our overlord LDM is as follows >>>>

<---------> Restrictions <--------->

None. My money was on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/1/academy-rector">Rector</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/66/flash">Flash</a> being miserable. I think people still don't like getting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/38c/hymn-to-tourach">Hymn</a>'ed but there were no dominating <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/38c/hymn-to-tourach">Hymn</a> decks.

<---------> Unrestrictions <--------->

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/126/grim-monolith">Grim Monolith</a>* The lack of emergant prison decks is concerning to a group who loves to inflict misery and suffering on opponents. We debated either <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/315/ancient-tomb">Ancient Tomb</a> or the <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/126/grim-monolith">Monolith</a> but decided <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/126/grim-monolith">Monolith</a> is the less flexible worse of the two. It does combo with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/314/voltaic-key">Voltaic Key</a> but when scanning the amount of things that cost 3 (or 4 in the case of the nut draw, Sol Land -> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/126/grim-monolith">Grim</a> -> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/314/voltaic-key">Key</a> -> Untap -> 4 mana) the scariest thing we came up with is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/135/metalworker">Metalworker</a>. We decided we want to see a playable <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/135/metalworker">Metalworker</a> deck. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/126/grim-monolith">Monolith</a> could also support casting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/por/5/armageddon">Armageddon</a> quickly. The downside is it does support casting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/1/academy-rector">Rector</a> quickly. Pick up your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/wth/154/null-rod">Null Rods</a> now the age of iron has begun!

<h2>OBSERVE LIST:</h2>
<hr/>

<<<<==Unrestrict==>>>>

With a restricted list in place, it can be argued that *<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a>* has few targets that can be considered "broken." A powerful card for sure but possibly a candidate for unrestriction. A world without <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/129/memory-jar">Memory Jar</a> would almost certainly see <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a> unrestricted.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/vis/80/goblin-recruiter">Goblin Recruiter</a>* has proven to be fairly benign. If anything <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/190/goblin-lackey">Lackey</a> leads to far broken game starts than recruiter. It's synergy with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/246/food-chain">Food Chain</a> was also over stated. Adding <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/246/food-chain">Food Chain</a> to an otherwise streamlined Goblin deck gives your opponent something to take with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/132/duress">Duress</a>, adds a second color and over all just waters the deck down.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/315/ancient-tomb">Ancient Tomb</a>* remains. If we face <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/135/metalworker">Metalworker</a> utter domination then clearly <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/315/ancient-tomb">Ancient Tomb</a> must remain beneath the remains.

CITIES IN RUINS

BODIES PACKED ON MINEFIELDS

NEUROTIC GAME OF LIFE AND DEATH

NOW I CAN FEEL THE END

PREMONITION ABOUT MY FINAL HOUR

A SAD IMAGE OF EVERYTHING

EVERYTHING'S SO REAL

WHO HAS WON?

WHO HAS DIED?

BENEATH THE REMAINS

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sth/108/hermit-druid">Hermit Druid</a>* I'm not convinced tihs is much better than <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/66/flash">Flash</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/1/academy-rector">Rector</a>. It gets distrupted by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/132/duress">Zwang</a>, by grave hate, by creature kill and by bad luck. But it is if everything falls perfectly a 1 card combo. The key difference in hyper is you still need a reanimation spell in hand or must go through a complex <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jud/122/krosan-reclamation">Krosan Reclamation</a> to rebuild a small deck only to get your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jud/73/sutured-ghoul">ghoul</a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ice/54/swords-to-plowshares">plowed</a> or to have me <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ody/94/predict">Predict</a> the fucking reanimation spell off your deck.

<<<<==Restrict==>>>>

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/66/flash">Flash</a>* is the basis of a degenerate, and frankly, boring turn one combo that we completely forgot about. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/1/academy-rector">Rector</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/75/yawgmoths-bargain">Bargain</a>. Our resident Flash Rectum player has absurdly shitty luck which may have artifically deflated this archtypes performance. 

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/307/lions-eye-diamond">Lion's Eye Diamond</a>* has a converted mana cost of 0 and makes three mana of any one color. It's pretty fucked with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/171/yawgmoths-will">Yawgmoth's Will</a>.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/exo/115/oath-of-druids">Oath of Druids</a>* is miserable but given the power level of the fatties might not be that broken. There's also no orchard which gives opposing decks a chance to interact a little bit.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/103/time-spiral">Time Spiral</a>* when it resolves the game mostly ends. Just restricting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">High Tide</a> would also kill the deck. It's hard to justify restricting a 6 mana sorcery that exiles itself but it makes the turn 4 <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">high tide</a> kill pretty consistant.

<<<<==Fallen Empires==>>>>

One thing we're hoping to avoid is just having the same old 93/94 decks and play patterns in Hyper. This is what emerges when you allow shit like 4th edition. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/34/land-tax">Land Tax</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/273/sylvan-library">Sylvan</a>, every 1 or 2 color aggro deck automatically has 4 <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/361/mishras-factory">Factories</a>. Every red deck has <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/208/lightning-bolt">Bolt</a> and you have to clean up the mistakes like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/6/balance">Balance</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/147/mind-twist">Mind Twist</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/236/channel">Channel</a> in your restricted or banned list.

In keeping with this idea we've considered just nuking Fallen Empires from orbit. It is an unattached set that you can argue doesn't fit with the semi modern set design that started with Ice Age.

There are only 4-5 playable cards in the set but they make decks or play patterns. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">High Tide</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/38c/hymn-to-tourach">Hymn to Tourcock</a> and to a lesser extent the tribal and aggro creatures.

Fallen Empires lives another day
