<<< HYPEREXTENDED POST-CASTLEGATE CLASSIC RESTRICTED LIST ANNOUNCEMENT >>>


<<<< The council has spoken, the final ruling from our overlord LDM is as follows >>>>

<---------> Restrictions <--------->

{% card "Academy Rector" %} has fallen. The decision to restrict Rector vs. {% card "Flash" %} came down to {% card "Flash" %} just being a worse Magic: the Gathering card. It's easier to hate with broad cards like Zwang, Pyroknall and {% card "Disrupt" %}. {% card "Flash" %} / {% card "Symbiotic Wurm" %} is not awful but it's beatable by racing and by sweepers. Rector can just be cast off Rituals or {% card "Grim Monolith" %} and with a {% card "Cabal Therapy" %} in the graveyard produces {% card "Yawmogth's Bargain" %}.

{% card "Academy Rector" %} is restricted, and has paid for Yawgmoth's sins.

<---------> Unrestrictions <--------->

{% card "Hermit Druid" %} is unrestricted. After watching plain old reanimator in action the thought of a {% card "Sutured Ghoul" %} with {% card "Dragon Breath" %} became pretty laughable. The amount of hurdle durdle needed to get this working is just not worth it. Druid also folds to every hate card as well as shit like {% card "Seal of Fire" %}. It's bad.

{% card "Hermit Druid" %} is unrestricted, go fucking nuts.

{% card "Dream Halls" %} is unrestricted. With {% card "Flash" %} combo being kicked in the taint we thought we'd let another terrible multicard combo card loose. {% card "Dream Halls" %} is 5 mana, looses to everything and is symmetrical.
It might provide something to do with {% card "Grim Monolith" %} which was pretty non-existant at the Castlegate.

{% card "Dream Halls" %} is unrestricted, have fun getting 3 burn spells, {% card "Pyroblast" %}s or {% card "Disenchant" %} effects thrown at your face in response to going off.
