<<<< The council has spoken, the final ruling from our overlord LDM is as follows >>>>

<<<<== Restrictions ==>>>>

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/61/brainstorm">Brainstorm</a>* is hopelessly busted in any format with fetchlands and Hyper has been no exception. The fact that there are no duals and limited fetches has helped a bit. That being said it's been paired with other shuffles like Tutors, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/all/144/thawing-glaciers">Thawing Glaciers</a> and even <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/exo/129/survival-of-the-fittest">Survival</a>. There are viable 16-18 land decks because of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/61/brainstorm">Brainstorm</a>. By restricting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/61/brainstorm">Brainstorm</a> we feel we can keep many of the 2 card combo decks around for know. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">High Tide</a> also lives to see another day but I think with 1 <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/61/brainstorm">Brainstorm</a> is greatly weakened.

It gives me great pleasure to announce <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/61/brainstorm">Brainstorm</a> is Restricted.

<<<<== Unrestrictions ==>>>>

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/82/gush">Gush</a>* with the beta dual lands is a pretty busted card advantage engine. In Hyper your mana base is highly constrained, a 2 color <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/82/gush">Gush</a> deck for example that has to play <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/apc/143/yavimaya-coast">Yavimaya Coast</a> with no way to fetch forest seems vulnerable. All this being said, at it's best <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/82/gush">Gush</a> is draw 2 cards for -2 mana which is hopelessly fucked up. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/82/gush">Gush</a> is unrestricted and will be placed on the Observe list.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/por/64/personal-tutor">Personal Tutor</a>* I will deliver, You know I'm a forgiver, Reach out and touch faith, Reach out and touch faith, Your own <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/por/64/personal-tutor">personal tutor</a>. 4 of them actually. No competitive deck even played the 1 tutor allowed. Given the existance of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/80/mystical-tutor">Mystical</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/vis/72/vampiric-tutor">Vampiric</a> the card disadvantage and slowness of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/por/64/personal-tutor">Personal</a> really stood out. Finally in U/b <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/all/107/lim-d%C3%BBls-vault">Lim Dul's Vault</a> is available and has proven to be pretty amazing at setting up combos. Finally restricting Brainstorm makes this unrestriction even safer, no longer can you really on the paragon of skill intense to get a top tutored spell into your hand. The obvious downside to this unrestriction is that decks now have 7 virtual <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/171/yawgmoths-will">Yawgmoth's Wills</a>. This could prove to be a problem, or people can play <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ice/93/ray-of-erasure">Ray of Erasure</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ody/94/predict">Predict</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/vis/33/foreshadow">Foreshadow</a> and shit knock this strategy into oblivion.

THE ROAD TO THE COMPUSERVE OPEN BEGINGS NOW!

To review the format ...

Hyper Extended is a constructed format which includes the following sets

Fallen Empires -> Scourge. Including the Black Bordered Portal sets One and Second Age.

No white bordered cards are allowed. No new frame or time shifted trash is allowed. You must use the card from the set and can't use reprints even going backwards. For example Ice Age contains <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ice/54/swords-to-plowshares">Swords to Plowshares</a>, you can't use a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/41/swords-to-plowshares">Revised</a> one, or a crappy <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/52/swords-to-plowshares">4th</a> one. You can't even use a gorgeous <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/leb/41/swords-to-plowshares">Beta</a> one. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/por/39/wrath-of-god">Wrath of God</a> is found only in Portal, you must use that one. If a card is in multiple legal sets you may use any, or mix and match to trigger your opponents.


All ante cards are banned.

Mana burn is on like donkey kong.

OBSERVE LIST:

<<<<==Unrestrict==>>>>

With a restricted list in place, it can be argued that *<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a>* has few targets that can be considered "broken." A powerful card for sure but possibly a candidate for unrestriction. A world without <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/129/memory-jar">Memory Jar</a> would almost certainly see <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a> unrestricted.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/vis/80/goblin-recruiter">Goblin Recruiter</a>* has proven to be fairly benign. If anything Lackey leads to far broken game starts than recruiter. It's synergy with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/246/food-chain">Food Chain</a> was also over stated. Adding <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/246/food-chain">Food Chain</a> to an otherwise streamlined Goblin deck gives your opponent something to take with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/132/duress">Duress</a>, adds a second color and over all just waters the deck down.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/315/ancient-tomb">Ancient Tomb</a>* and *<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/126/grim-monolith">Grim Monolith</a>* these two are to some extent paired at the hip. The lack or emergant prison decks is concerning to a group who loves to inflict misery and suffering on opponents. The feeling at this point is that it may be safe to unrestrict one of these two but likely not both. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/315/ancient-tomb">Ancient Tomb</a> would allow for mono color prison decks to emerge. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/126/grim-monolith">Monolith</a> would likely Turbo Charge <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/135/metalworker">Metalworker</a>.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ice/154/necropotence">Necropotence</a>* ... is utterly fucking busted. If you thought we were taking it off you are nuts.

<<<<==Restrict==>>>>

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/66/flash">Flash</a>* is the basis of a degenerate, and frankly, boring turn one combo that we completely forgot about. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/1/academy-rector">Rector</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/75/yawgmoths-bargain">Bargain</a>. I don't think anyone will have a good time with four copies of this spell hanging around, but we can try it as a playset first.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/307/lions-eye-diamond">Lion's Eye Diamond</a>* has a converted mana cost of 0 and makes three mana of any one color. It's pretty fucked with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/171/yawgmoths-will">Yawgmoth's Will</a>.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/exo/115/oath-of-druids">Oath of Druids</a>* is miserable but given the power level of the fatties might not be that broken. There's also no orchard which gives opposing decks a chance to interact a little bit.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/103/time-spiral">Time Spiral</a>* when it resolves the game mostly ends. Just restricting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">High Tide</a> would also kill the deck. It's hard to justify restricting a 6 mana sorcery that exiles itself but it makes the turn 4 <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">high tide</a> kill pretty consistant.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/82/gush">Gush</a>* seems very underwhelming given how mana bases work. It's best home so far has been in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/250/exploration">Exploration</a> / Turboland shells. Otherwise it's been thrown into various tempo decks. It certainly can't be a 4 of with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/61/brainstorm">Brainstorm</a> running loose.
