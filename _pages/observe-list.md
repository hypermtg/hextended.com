<<<<==Unrestrict==>>>>

With a restricted list in place, it can be argued that *<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a>* has few targets that can be considered "broken." A powerful card for sure but possibly a candidate for unrestriction. A world without <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/129/memory-jar">Memory Jar</a> would almost certainly see <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a> unrestricted.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/vis/80/goblin-recruiter">Goblin Recruiter</a>* has proven to be fairly benign. If anything <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/190/goblin-lackey">Lackey</a> leads to far broken game starts than recruiter. It's synergy with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/246/food-chain">Food Chain</a> was also over stated. Adding <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/246/food-chain">Food Chain</a> to an otherwise streamlined Goblin deck gives your opponent something to take with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/132/duress">Duress</a>, adds a second color and over all just waters the deck down.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/315/ancient-tomb">Ancient Tomb</a>* remains. If we face <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/135/metalworker">Metalworker</a> utter domination then clearly <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/315/ancient-tomb">Ancient Tomb</a> must remain beneath the remains.

CITIES IN RUINS

BODIES PACKED ON MINEFIELDS

NEUROTIC GAME OF LIFE AND DEATH

NOW I CAN FEEL THE END

PREMONITION ABOUT MY FINAL HOUR

A SAD IMAGE OF EVERYTHING

EVERYTHING'S SO REAL

WHO HAS WON?

WHO HAS DIED?

BENEATH THE REMAINS

<<<<==Restrict==>>>>

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/307/lions-eye-diamond">Lion's Eye Diamond</a>* has a converted mana cost of 0 and makes three mana of any one color. It's pretty fucked with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/171/yawgmoths-will">Yawgmoth's Will</a>.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/exo/115/oath-of-druids">Oath of Druids</a>* is miserable but given the power level of the fatties might not be that broken. There's also no orchard which gives opposing decks a chance to interact a little bit.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/103/time-spiral">Time Spiral</a>* when it resolves the game mostly ends. Just restricting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">High Tide</a> would also kill the deck. It's hard to justify restricting a 6 mana sorcery that exiles itself but it makes the turn 4 <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">high tide</a> kill pretty consistant.

<<<<==Fallen Empires==>>>>

One thing we're hoping to avoid is just having the same old 93/94 decks and play patterns in Hyper. This is what emerges when you allow shit like 4th edition. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/34/land-tax">Land Tax</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/273/sylvan-library">Sylvan</a>, every 1 or 2 color aggro deck automatically has 4 <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/361/mishras-factory">Factories</a>. Every red deck has <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/208/lightning-bolt">Bolt</a> and you have to clean up the mistakes like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/6/balance">Balance</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/147/mind-twist">Mind Twist</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/236/channel">Channel</a> in your restricted or banned list.

In keeping with this idea we've considered just nuking Fallen Empires from orbit. It is an unattached set that you can argue doesn't fit with the semi modern set design that started with Ice Age.

There are only 4-5 playable cards in the set but they make decks or play patterns. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">High Tide</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/38c/hymn-to-tourach">Hymn to Tourcock</a> and to a lesser extent the tribal and aggro creatures.

Fallen Empires lives another day
