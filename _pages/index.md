Hyper Extended is a constructed format composed of the black bordered sets from Fallen Empires to Scourge, including the Portal sets One and Second Age and the following promos.
<div id="promo-list">
    <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plgm/1/counterspell">DCI Counterspell (Dom! Art)</a>
    <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plgm/2/incinerate">DCI Incinerate (Jock Art)</a>
    <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/parl/7/fireball">DCI Fireball (Jock Art)</a>
</div>

No white bordered cards are allowed. No new frame or time shifted trash is allowed. You must use the card from the set and can't use reprints even going backwards. For example Ice Age contains <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ice/54/swords-to-plowshares">Swords to Plowshares</a>, you can't use a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/3ed/41/swords-to-plowshares">Revised</a> one, or a crappy <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/52/swords-to-plowshares">4th</a> one. You can't even use a gorgeous <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/leb/41/swords-to-plowshares">Beta</a> one. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/por/39/wrath-of-god">Wrath of God</a> is found only in Portal, you must use that one. If a card is in multiple legal sets you may use any, or mix and match to trigger your opponents.

Gold bordered "Championship" cards are permitted, given that they match a legal printing of the card and would be otherwise legal in the format. For example, you can use <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/wc98/bs129/survival-of-the-fittest">Survival of the Fittest</a>, but you still can't use <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/wc00/jk217/birds-of-paradise">Birds of Paradise</a>.

You may play basic lands from any of the promo sets in that time period, as well as those from Unglued.

All ante cards are banned.

Mana burn is on like donkey kong.

Wishes may retrieve cards from your sideboard or exile.

Modern day rules, such as Paris mulligans and the Scry rule, are in effect.

Here's a starter Scryfall search that you can use to check on whether various cards existed during this time period.

<h2>OBSERVE LIST:</h2>
<hr/>

<<<<==Unrestrict==>>>>

With a restricted list in place, it can be argued that *<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a>* has few targets that can be considered "broken." A powerful card for sure but possibly a candidate for unrestriction. A world without <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/129/memory-jar">Memory Jar</a> would almost certainly see <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ulg/45/tinker">Tinker</a> unrestricted.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/vis/80/goblin-recruiter">Goblin Recruiter</a>* has proven to be fairly benign. If anything <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/190/goblin-lackey">Lackey</a> leads to far broken game starts than recruiter. It's synergy with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/246/food-chain">Food Chain</a> was also over stated. Adding <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mmq/246/food-chain">Food Chain</a> to an otherwise streamlined Goblin deck gives your opponent something to take with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/132/duress">Duress</a>, adds a second color and over all just waters the deck down.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/315/ancient-tomb">Ancient Tomb</a>* remains. If we face <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/135/metalworker">Metalworker</a> utter domination then clearly <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/315/ancient-tomb">Ancient Tomb</a> must remain beneath the remains.

CITIES IN RUINS

BODIES PACKED ON MINEFIELDS

NEUROTIC GAME OF LIFE AND DEATH

NOW I CAN FEEL THE END

PREMONITION ABOUT MY FINAL HOUR

A SAD IMAGE OF EVERYTHING

EVERYTHING'S SO REAL

WHO HAS WON?

WHO HAS DIED?

BENEATH THE REMAINS

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sth/108/hermit-druid">Hermit Druid</a>* I'm not convinced tihs is much better than <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/66/flash">Flash</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/1/academy-rector">Rector</a>. It gets distrupted by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/132/duress">Zwang</a>, by grave hate, by creature kill and by bad luck. But it is if everything falls perfectly a 1 card combo. The key difference in hyper is you still need a reanimation spell in hand or must go through a complex <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jud/122/krosan-reclamation">Krosan Reclamation</a> to rebuild a small deck only to get your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/jud/73/sutured-ghoul">ghoul</a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ice/54/swords-to-plowshares">plowed</a> or to have me <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ody/94/predict">Predict</a> the fucking reanimation spell off your deck.

<<<<==Restrict==>>>>

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/66/flash">Flash</a>* is the basis of a degenerate, and frankly, boring turn one combo that we completely forgot about. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/1/academy-rector">Rector</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uds/75/yawgmoths-bargain">Bargain</a>. Our resident Flash Rectum player has absurdly shitty luck which may have artifically deflated this archtypes performance. 

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mir/307/lions-eye-diamond">Lion's Eye Diamond</a>* has a converted mana cost of 0 and makes three mana of any one color. It's pretty fucked with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/171/yawgmoths-will">Yawgmoth's Will</a>.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/exo/115/oath-of-druids">Oath of Druids</a>* is miserable but given the power level of the fatties might not be that broken. There's also no orchard which gives opposing decks a chance to interact a little bit.

*<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/103/time-spiral">Time Spiral</a>* when it resolves the game mostly ends. Just restricting <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">High Tide</a> would also kill the deck. It's hard to justify restricting a 6 mana sorcery that exiles itself but it makes the turn 4 <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">high tide</a> kill pretty consistant.

<<<<==Fallen Empires==>>>>

One thing we're hoping to avoid is just having the same old 93/94 decks and play patterns in Hyper. This is what emerges when you allow shit like 4th edition. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/34/land-tax">Land Tax</a> / <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/273/sylvan-library">Sylvan</a>, every 1 or 2 color aggro deck automatically has 4 <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/361/mishras-factory">Factories</a>. Every red deck has <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/208/lightning-bolt">Bolt</a> and you have to clean up the mistakes like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/6/balance">Balance</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/147/mind-twist">Mind Twist</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/4ed/236/channel">Channel</a> in your restricted or banned list.

In keeping with this idea we've considered just nuking Fallen Empires from orbit. It is an unattached set that you can argue doesn't fit with the semi modern set design that started with Ice Age.

There are only 4-5 playable cards in the set but they make decks or play patterns. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/18b/high-tide">High Tide</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fem/38c/hymn-to-tourach">Hymn to Tourcock</a> and to a lesser extent the tribal and aggro creatures.

Fallen Empires lives another day
